<h2>
    Stress is probably super common at this point, but that doesn't mean it is
    normal. I just wanted to give you a few options to destress and regroup. Usually,
    when were stressed it is becuase of time or rather lack of time, but we can't
    stress over deadlines and expectations. Though this is easier said than done,
    I want you to really try to allow yourself to take a deep breath no matter how
    long it takes.
